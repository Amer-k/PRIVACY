    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 2025</p>
    <p><strong>App name:</strong> FatwaAI<br>
    <strong>Developer / Data controller:</strong> Amer Alkawareet<br>
    <strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:efatwa.ai@gmail.com">efatwa.ai@gmail.com</a></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how FatwaAI ("we", "our", or "the app") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile application (including on Android and iOS).</p>

    <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>

    <h4>1.1 Information you provide when using the app</h4>
    <p><strong>Fatwa requests:</strong> When you ask a question, we receive the question text, your chosen Islamic school of thought (e.g. Hanafi, Maliki), and your language preference. This data is sent to our backend servers and to a third-party AI provider (OpenAI) to generate the response.</p>
    <p><strong>Account information (optional):</strong> If you sign in (e.g. with email/password or Google), we use Firebase Authentication. Firebase may process your email address and, if you use Google Sign-In, basic profile information (e.g. name, profile photo) as per Google's and Firebase's policies. We use this only to authenticate you; we do not store your questions or fatwa history on our servers in a way tied to your identity.</p>

    <h4>1.2 Information stored only on your device</h4>
    <p><strong>Saved fatwas:</strong> Any fatwas you choose to save are stored only on your device. We do not store saved fatwas on our servers.</p>

    <h4>1.3 Automatically collected information</h4>
    <p><strong>Logs:</strong> Our backend may log limited technical and usage data (e.g. truncated or hashed identifiers, request metadata) for security, debugging, and service operation. We do not permanently store the full text of your questions in a searchable database.</p>
    <p><strong>Ads:</strong> The app may show ads via Google AdMob. AdMob may collect device and usage data (e.g. device ID, ad interactions) according to Google's Privacy Policy and your ad personalization settings.</p>

    <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>To generate fatwa responses (including sending your question and preferences to OpenAI).</li>
      <li>To authenticate you when you sign in (via Firebase).</li>
      <li>To operate, secure, and improve the app (e.g. logs, error handling).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell your personal data.</p>

    <h3>3. Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>We use:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>OpenAI</strong> – AI-generated fatwa text. Your question is sent to OpenAI; see <a href="https://openai.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> – Ads in the app. May collect data per <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a>; you can manage ad settings in your device/Google account.</li>
      <li><strong>Firebase (Google)</strong> – Authentication (sign-in). See <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firebase/Google Privacy</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not control these third parties. Their use of data is governed by their respective policies.</p>

    <h3>4. Data Retention and Storage</h3>
    <p>Questions and fatwa text are sent to our backend and OpenAI to generate a response. We do not retain them in a permanent, user-identifiable database. Server logs may be kept for a limited time for security and operation, then deleted or anonymized. Saved fatwas are stored only on your device; we have no access once you delete them or uninstall the app. Account data is handled by Firebase/Google; retention is per their policies.</p>

    <h3>5. Your Rights and Choices</h3>
    <p>You can delete saved fatwas at any time from within the app. You can sign out or delete your account (where supported); account data is subject to Firebase/Google's policies. Uninstalling the app removes locally stored data (e.g. saved fatwas) from that device. You can limit ad tracking in your device settings; subscribing to our premium option (where available) removes ads in the app. If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), UK, or other regions with similar laws, you may have additional rights (e.g. access, correction, deletion, portability, objection). To exercise them, contact us at <a href="mailto:efatwa.ai@gmail.com">efatwa.ai@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <h3>6. Security</h3>
    <p>We use industry-standard measures (e.g. HTTPS, secure authentication) to protect data in transit and in our systems. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h3>7. Children</h3>
    <p>The app is not directed at children under 13 (or equivalent minimum age in your country). We do not knowingly collect personal data from such users. If you believe we have collected such data, please contact us and we will delete it.</p>

    <h3>8. International Transfers</h3>
    <p>Our backend and third parties (e.g. OpenAI, Google) may process data in countries outside your residence. By using the app, you consent to such transfer where permitted by law. We rely on appropriate safeguards (e.g. standard contractual clauses) where required.</p>

    <h3>9. Changes to This Policy</h3>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the revised policy with a new "Last updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy. For material changes, we may notify you in the app or via email if we have it.</p>

    <h3>10. Contact</h3>
    <p>For privacy-related questions, account deletion requests, or complaints: <a href="mailto:efatwa.ai@gmail.com">efatwa.ai@gmail.com</a>. You can also find a link to this policy in the app (Settings) or on the FatwaAI store page.</p>
